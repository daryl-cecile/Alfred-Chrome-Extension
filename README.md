# Alfred Chrome Extension (PoC)

Speed-coded chrome extension that automatically "cleans up" (closes) old tabs that havent been used for a while. 
This extension gives you the ability to set up ignore rules for urls, and allows you to set a TTL for the tabs.

Due to time constraints and nature (PoC) of this project, the code in this repo has not been tested extensively - **use at your own risks**. PRs accepted.

User tested in Chrome and Brave browsers
